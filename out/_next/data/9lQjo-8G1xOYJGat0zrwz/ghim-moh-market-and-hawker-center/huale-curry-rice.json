The family that runs this business are friendly and pleasant to interact with. Sometimes you even get extra at the end of the day. Highly recommend the bitter gourd with egg, stir-fried to perfection"},"images":[{"link":"images/hawker-centers/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre/huale-curry-rice.jpg"}],"location":{"id":"ad62f958-5900-47e9-8597-bad96b0b2496","name":"Ghim Moh Market and Hawker Centre","slug":"ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-center","postalCode":"270020","images":[{"link":"images/hawker-centers/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre.jpg"}],"createdAt":"2021-05-23T18:25:41.302Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-23T18:25:41.302Z"},"createdAt":"2021-05-24T12:31:08.800Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-24T12:31:08.800Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
