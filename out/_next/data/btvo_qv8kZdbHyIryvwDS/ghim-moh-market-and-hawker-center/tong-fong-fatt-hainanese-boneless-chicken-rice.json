{"pageProps":{"stallData":{"name":"Tong Fong Fatt Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice","stallNumber":"01-24","information":{"price":"$3 - $5","dishes":"Chicken Rice","favorites":"Half a chicken and 2 rice, gizzards!","description":"Best Chicken Rice in SG. Favourite stall in Ghim Moh ever since childhood. Everyone I have ever brought to try has been a convert. Their chicken is soft, sauce is packed with flavour and the soup is comfort in a bowl. The price has also stayed at $2.50 even after 15 years. If I had 1 stall to recommend in Ghim Moh Market, this would be it. Am good friends with some of the loyal aunties and uncles that have stayed on.
