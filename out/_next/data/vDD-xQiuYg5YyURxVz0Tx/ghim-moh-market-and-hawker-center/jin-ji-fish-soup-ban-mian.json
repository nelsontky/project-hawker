Soup is super flavourful and free-flow spring onions also helps. The owner is a nice and generous guy and I used to always eat ban mian as a post-workout meal. Highly reccommend the dry you mian with their chilli, does not dissapoint.</p><p><strong>Price</strong><br/>$3 - $5</p><p><strong>Favorites</strong><br/>You Mian Dry</p>","images":[{"link":"images/hawker-centers/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre/jin-ji-fish-soup-ban-mian.jpg"}],"location":{"id":"ad62f958-5900-47e9-8597-bad96b0b2496","name":"Ghim Moh Market and Hawker Centre","slug":"ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-center","postalCode":"270020","images":[{"link":"images/hawker-centers/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre.jpg"}],"createdAt":"2021-05-23T18:25:41.302Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-23T18:25:41.302Z"},"createdAt":"2021-05-23T18:26:13.329Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-23T18:26:13.329Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
