Favourite stall in Ghim Moh ever since childhood. Everyone I have ever brought to try has been a convert. Their chicken is soft, sauce is packed with flavour and the soup is comfort in a bowl. The price has also stayed at $2.50 even after 15 years. If I had 1 stall to recommend in Ghim Moh Market, this would be it. Am good friends with some of the loyal aunties and uncles that have stayed on. </p><p><strong>Price</strong><br/>$3 - $5</p><p><strong>Favorites</strong><br/>Half a chicken and 2 rice, gizzards!</p>","images":[{"link":"images/hawker-centers/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre/tong-fong-fatt-hainanese-boneless-chicken-rice.jpg"}],"location":{"id":"ad62f958-5900-47e9-8597-bad96b0b2496","name":"Ghim Moh Market and Hawker Centre","slug":"ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-center","postalCode":"270020","images":[{"link":"images/hawker-centers/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre/ghim-moh-market-and-hawker-centre.jpg"}],"createdAt":"2021-05-23T18:25:41.302Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-23T18:25:41.302Z"},"createdAt":"2021-05-23T18:26:13.301Z","updatedAt":"2021-05-23T18:26:13.301Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
